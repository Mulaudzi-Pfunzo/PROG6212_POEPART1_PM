# PROG6212_POEPART1_PM
ontract Monthly Claim System
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Contract Monthly Claim System, a C# application developed using .NET and ASP.NET Core MVC. This project was created for the PROG6212: Programming 2B module.

Project Overview
The system is designed to manage and track monthly claims related to contracts. It features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and is built with a focus on a clear, maintainable architecture. The project's development follows version control best practices to ensure a complete and traceable history of all changes.

Project Documentation & Structure
Documentation: This project's documentation, including the UML diagrams and a detailed project plan, is available within the repository.

Version Control: Regular, meaningful commits are used throughout the development process to document progress.

Code: The application's source code will be organized into logical folders based on the ASP.NET Core MVC framework. (Note: No code snippets are currently included in this file.)

That's a great start to your project documentation! Here is the updated README.md content, including the new Part 2 section detailing the expanded functionality, which will be helpful for your module submission.

Part 2: Application Functional Expansion 
The Contract Monthly Claim System has been significantly expanded to implement a full claim lifecycle workflow for both Lecturers and Coordinators.

Expanded Functionality
The application now provides role-specific functionality to ensure claims are managed efficiently:

Lecturer Functionality (Claim Management):

Lecturers can now update existing claims after submission. This ensures flexibility for correcting errors or adjusting hours before approval.

Lecturers gain full visibility into the claims process, allowing them to view the current status (Pending, Approved, or Rejected) of all their submitted claims.

Coordinator Functionality (Claim Approval Workflow):

Coordinators are provided with a dedicated Approval Dashboard showing all pending claims.

Coordinators can now officially approve or reject claims. This process includes an audit trail, as all status changes require the coordinator to submit mandatory comments explaining their decision.

This multi-role functionality ensures a robust and traceable system for contract monthly claims.
